# SAT Solver in Python using orthonormal expansion

This is a Python implementation implementation based on orthonormal expansion approach. The details of the approacfh can be found in paper [An algorithm for Boolean satisfiability based on generalized orthonormal expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4712).

The implementation is intended for learning basics of SAT solving and hence does not use advanced level of heuristics. So the performance of this implementation is not competitive to the SAT solvers implementated to solve large sized SAT instances.
